ML Model for Continuous Data Prediction

Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning model to analyze and predict outcomes using a continuous dataset. The model is trained on numerical data and utilizes Linear Regression to make accurate forecasts. The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment scripts.

Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature selection)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Training and evaluation of a Linear Regression model

Deployment-ready script with model inference

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of continuous numerical features representing real-world observations. The dataset is preprocessed to remove inconsistencies and optimize model performance.
